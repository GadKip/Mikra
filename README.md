# Mikra
Free app for reading Mikra in modern Hebrew alongside ancient Hebrew


After reviewing the codebase, here are the potential issues that should be addressed:

Security:
In appwrite.js, sensitive configuration values like projectId and databaseId should be moved to environment variables instead of being hardcoded.
Error Handling:
In app/(books)/index.jsx/index.jsx), the fetchBooks error handling could be more specific about what failed
In appwrite.js, generic error messages in listFiles could be more descriptive
Performance:
In app/(books)/index.jsx/index.jsx), the books data structure could be memoized to prevent unnecessary re-renders
In CustomRenderHTML.jsx, consider adding memoization for the processed HTML content
Accessibility:
In CustomButton.jsx, add proper accessibility labels
In CustomAlert.jsx, add proper role attributes for screen readers
Type Safety:
Consider adding TypeScript or PropTypes to the components, especially for:
CustomAlert.jsx
CustomButton.jsx
CustomRenderHTML.jsx
Code Organization:
Consider moving the font configurations in CustomRenderHTML.jsx to a separate configuration file
The alert styles in CustomAlert.jsx could be moved to a styles file
Dependencies:
In package.json, some dependencies might need version updates for security fixes
Consider adding peer dependencies explicitly
Testing:
No test files are present in the codebase
Should add unit tests for components and integration tests for the Appwrite functionality
These improvements would make the codebase more maintainable, secure, and robust.
